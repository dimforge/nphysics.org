# Deformable bodies

!!! Warning
    The documentation of deformable bodies is still work-in-progress. You may refer to the examples
    for details on how to use those bodies:
    
    * [`mass_constraint_system2.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples2d/mass_constraint_system2.rs):
      the fastest approach: a 2D deformable object modeled with the mass-spring system
      modeling where each spring is simulated by a constraint.
    * [`mass_constraint_system3.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples3d/mass_constraint_system3.rs):
      the fastest approach: a 3D deformable object modeled with the mass-spring system
      modeling where each spring is simulated by a constraint.
    * [`mass_spring_system2.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples2d/mass_spring_system2.rs):
      a 2D deformable object modeled with the mass-spring system modeling.
    * [`mass_spring_system3.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples3d/mass_spring_system3.rs):
      a 3D deformable object modeled with the mass-spring system modeling.
    * [`fem_surface2.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples2d/fem_surface2.rs):
      a 2D deformable object modeled with the finite-element method (linear elasticity).
    * [`fem_volume3.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples3d/fem_volume3.rs):
      a 3D deformable object modeled with the finite-element method (linear elasticity).
    * [`plasticity2.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples2d/plasticity2.rs):
      a 2D deformable object that can suffer to permanent deformations.
    * [`plasticity3.rs`](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples3d/plasticity3.rs):
      a 3D deformable object that can suffer to permanent deformations.
